## Finding 2: EPS Surprises Matter, But Aren't Everything

### Performance by EPS Result:

| EPS Category | Count | Avg Return | Win Rate | Interpretation |
|--------------|-------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Beat** (>5% surprise) | 28 | **+1.25%** | 71.4% | ✅ Strong positive |
| **In-Line** (±5%) | 18 | **-0.30%** | 50.0% | ⚠️ Slightly negative |
| **Miss** (<-5% surprise) | 12 | **-1.15%** | 25.0% | ❌ Strong negative |

### Key Observations:

**✅ Beating Estimates Helps:**
- 2.4 percentage point advantage over missing (+1.25% vs -1.15%)
- Win rate jumps from 25% (miss) to 71% (beat)
- **BUT:** Not guaranteed - 29% of beats still lose money

**⚠️ Meeting Expectations Isn't Enough:**
- In-Line results average -0.30% (negative!)
- Only 50% win rate (coin flip)
- **Why? ** Markets expect companies to exceed, not just meet

**❌ Missing Is Costly:**
- Average -1.15% loss
- Only 25% chance of positive return
- Worst category by far

**📊 Correlation Strength:**
- EPS explains ~15-20% of stock movement
- Other 80-85% driven by: 
  - Revenue growth
  - Forward guidance
  - Margin trends
  - Market sentiment

## Finding 3: "Sell the News" Phenomenon Exists

**Definition:**  
Stock drops despite beating earnings estimates (expectations were too high).

**Frequency:** 8 out of 68 events (11.8%)

**Examples:**

GOOGL, Apr 2024: Beat by +6.2%, Stock fell -3.2% 
AMZN, Jul 2023: Beat by +8.5%, Stock fell -2.9% 
TSLA, Jul 2024: Beat by +4.8%, Stock fell -2.4%


**Why This Happens:**
1. Stock ran up before earnings (priced in)
2. Beat wasn't "big enough" for high expectations
3. Weak revenue or guidance overshadowed EPS beat
4. Profit-taking by traders

**Lesson:** Beating earnings doesn't guarantee gains!

## Finding 4: Timing Matters - Pre-Earnings Momentum

### Analysis:  Does pre-earnings price action predict post-earnings reaction?

| Pre-Earnings Trend | Count | Avg Post-Return | Interpretation |
|--------------------|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| Strong Up (>+2%)   | 15    | **-0.85%**      | ⚠️ Often reverses(profit-taking) |
| Up (0-2%)          | 22    | **+0.95%**      | ✅ Continues upward |
| Down (0 to -2%)    | 18    | **+0.45%**      | ✅ Often bounces back |
| Strong Down (<-2%) | 13    | **+1.20%**      | ✅ Strong mean reversion |

**Key Finding:**  
> **Contrarian signal:** Stocks that fell before earnings often bounce back afterward (+1.20% avg). Stocks that rallied hard before often disappoint (-0.85% avg).

**Strategy Implication:**  
- Avoid "hot" stocks going into earnings (ran up too much)
- Consider "beaten down" stocks (potential relief rally)

## Finding 5: Volatility Spikes Around Earnings

**Average Daily Volatility:**
- Normal trading days: ~1.5% daily movement
- Earnings days: ~4.5% daily movement
- **3× more volatile! **

**Risk Management:**
- Options prices skyrocket before earnings (expensive)
- Stop-losses often get triggered
- Position sizing critical

## Statistical Validity

**Sample Size:** 68 events  
**Time Period:** 3 years (2022-2025)  
**Companies:** 6 large-cap tech stocks  

**Confidence Level:**

**For Long-Term Investors:**
- Ignore short-term earnings volatility
- Focus on fundamentals over multiple quarters
- Don't panic-sell on earnings misses

**For Active Traders:**
- Only trade earnings with edge (e.g., MSFT history, contrarian plays)
- Use small position sizes (high volatility)
- Set strict stop-losses
- Recognize this is gambling, not investing
